# Introduction
Project name - COVID-19 emergency response and e-catalogues sustainability and energy efficiency 

Location - Ukraine

Beneficiary - Ministry for Development of Economy, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine

Project dates - April, 2021 - April, 2022

## Background

The coronavirus pandemic has generated a major economic crisis, with a halt in production across the globe and a collapse in consumption and confidence. As a result, the pandemic has led to almost every Fortune 1000 company to experience an interruption of their routine business operations. Across nearly every industry, multinational companies are confronting the stark reality that business will not go on as usual. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has predicted that the coronavirus pandemic will cause a global recession in 2020 that could be worse than the one triggered by the global financial crisis of 2008-2009. Furthermore, the pandemic is causing an unprecedented public health emergency which has caused large–scale loss of life and infections nearing 1 million globally.

Rapid and efficient procurement of life-saving goods and services is essential in the fight against the coronavirus. In order to tackle the health emergency efficiently, and rapidly, it is pivotal that governments and the Central Executive Body (CEB) are able to procure the necessary equipment, in particular, personal protection equipment. Only when hospitals, care homes and citizens are able to fully protect themselves can the spread of the virus be controlled. However, it has become increasingly evident that governments are not able to ensure the efficient procurement of these essential goods using standard procurement procedures but must rapidly resort to emergency procedures and negotiated arrangements. How they manage that emergency procurement will play a major role in how they contain COVID-19 and how many lives can be saved. Public procurement needs to be fast, smart and open if it’s going to be efficient during the crisis.  

Against this background, the Ministry for Development of Economy, Trade and Agriculture of Ukraine (MDETA) has requested the technical assistance of the EBRD with facilitating a number of electronic public procurement procedures in order to enable the Centralised Procurement Body (“CPB”) to conduct emergency public procurement more efficiently and rapidly during the crisis. In particular, the CPB in Ukraine is working on the development of an innovative procurement tool “e-catalogues” and centralised procurement services based on electronic framework agreements to make electronic procurement faster and more efficient and transparent, which has become very important for the government during the COVID-19 emergency procurement. In particular, the Ministry and the CPB require EBRDs assistance to scale e-catalog and to implement Sustainable Development Goals by placing energy-efficiency products in the e-catalog. Having energy-efficient products in the e-catalog will simplify the access of all procuring entities in Ukraine to such goods and services, and as a result will increase the global energy efficiency indicator. 

In order to support the Ministry and the CPB during this unpreceded times, the EBRD has initiated a new technical assistance project with the objective to support the Ministry, the CPB and the CEB in Ukraine during the COVID-19 crisis with making electronic procurement faster and more transparent and efficient.

## Objectives of the project

In compliance with international best practices, the overall objective of the assignment is to support the Ministry, the CPB, and the Central Executive Body (CEB) in Ukraine during the COVID-19 crisis by making electronic procurement faster and more transparent and efficient. 

By upgrading the e-catalogs and implementing emergency public procurement procedures in the e-procurement system (Prozorro), the Assignment contributes to improving the quality of the procurement itself and saving resources of the CPB organization by reducing the procurement bodies’ workload to enable them to focus on counteracting the spread of COVID-19.

## Technological approach

Elaborating energy-efficient product categories in electronic catalog Prozorro Market.
Qualification of suppliers of energy-efficient product categories in electronic catalog.
Proceeding procurement applications of Central Executive Bodies.
